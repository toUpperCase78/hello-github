# hello-github
That's my first repository to understand how github works...

Here, I wrote another line which enables me to edit this readme file.

OK, OK, after a very long time since I created this repository, it's time to master the markdown features and test them all in such a readme file. That's because when I include more repositories, it needs to be clean and understandable.

Let's create some lists:
1. First ordered list item
2. Second ordered list item
3. Third ordered list item

* First unordered list item
* Second unordered list item
* Third unordered list item

- First main list item
- Second main list item
  - First sub list item
  - Second sub list item
- Third main list item
  - Third sub list item
  - Fourth sub list item
  
If you want some words to have fonts like Consolas, then use `backquotes`.

To quote a statement:
> You have to set it like this.
> And this, alright?

Sometimes, there might be some piece of codes you'd like to include:
```
function hello(string) {
    return "Hello, " + string
}
```

But, that's just a like plain text. To get it colored for a specific language:
```python
def hello(string):
    return "Hello," + string
 ```
 
 Am I allowed to mention myself @toUpperCase78 here?
 
 Well, perhaps the time has come to create tasks:
 
 - [X] Mastered texts
 - [X] Mastered lists
 - [ ] Mastered images
 - [X] Mastered headers & quotes
 - [X] Mastered codes
 - [ ] And some other useful things
 
 All right, moving on to tables!
